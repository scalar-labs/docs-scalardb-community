# Getting Started with ScalarDB by Using Kotlin

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This getting started tutorial explains how to configure your preferred database in ScalarDB and set up a basic electronic money application by using Kotlin. Since Kotlin has Java interoperability, you can use ScalarDB directly from Kotlin.

:::warning

The electronic money application is simplified for this tutorial and isn't suitable for a production environment.

:::

## Prerequisites for this sample application

Because ScalarDB is written in Java, you must have one of the following Java Development Kits (JDKs) installed in your environment:

- [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) 8
- OpenJDK 8 from [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/), [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/), or [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download)

:::note

This sample application only works with Java 8. However, ScalarDB itself works with Java LTS versions, which means that you can use Java LTS versions for your application that uses ScalarDB. For details on the requirements of ScalarDB, such as which Java versions can be used, see [Requirements](./requirements.mdx).

:::

In addition, since you'll be using Docker Compose to run the databases, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) 20.10 or later with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) V2 or later installed.

## Clone the ScalarDB samples repository

Open **Terminal**, then clone the ScalarDB samples repository by running the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb-samples
```

Then, go to the directory that contains the sample application by running the following command:

```console
cd scalardb-samples/scalardb-kotlin-sample
```

## Set up your database for ScalarDB

Select your database, and follow the instructions to configure it for ScalarDB.

## Load the database schema

You need to define the database schema (the method in which the data will be organized) in the application. For details about the supported data types, see [Data type mapping between ScalarDB and other databases](schema-loader.mdx#data-type-mapping-between-scalardb-and-other-databases).

For this tutorial, a file named **schema.json** already exists in the `scalardb-samples/scalardb-kotlin-sample` directory. To apply the schema, go to the [`scalardb` Releases](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases) page and download the ScalarDB Schema Loader that matches the version of ScalarDB that you are using to the `scalardb-samples/scalardb-kotlin-sample` directory.

Then, based on your database, run the following command, replacing `<VERSION>` with the version of the ScalarDB Schema Loader that you downloaded:

<Tabs groupId="databases" queryString>
  <TabItem value="MySQL" label="MySQL" default>
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL" default>
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Oracle Database" label="Oracle Database" default>
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="SQL Server" label="SQL Server" default>
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="DynamoDB" label="DynamoDB">
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator --no-backup --no-scaling
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

Also, `--no-backup` and `--no-scaling` options are specified because Amazon DynamoDB Local does not support continuous backup and auto-scaling.

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Cosmos_DB_for_NoSQL" label="Cosmos DB for NoSQL">
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Cassandra" label="Cassandra">
    ```console
    java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator --replication-factor=1
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

In addition, the `--replication-factor=1` option has an effect only when using Cassandra. The default replication factor is `3`, but to facilitate the setup in this tutorial, `1` is used so that you only need to prepare a cluster with one node instead of three nodes. However, keep in mind that a replication factor of `1` is not suited for production.

## Execute transactions and retrieve data in the basic electronic money application

After loading the schema, you can execute transactions and retrieve data in the basic electronic money application that is included in the repository that you cloned.

The application supports the following types of transactions:

- Create an account.
- Add funds to an account.
- Send funds between two accounts.
- Get an account balance.

:::note

When you first execute a Gradle command, Gradle will automatically install the necessary libraries.

:::

### Create an account with a balance

You need an account with a balance so that you can send funds between accounts.

To create an account for **customer1** that has a balance of **500**, run the following command:

```console
./gradlew run --args="-action charge -amount 500 -to customer1"
```

### Create an account without a balance

After setting up an account that has a balance, you need another account for sending funds to.

To create an account for **merchant1** that has a balance of **0**, run the following command:

```console
./gradlew run --args="-action charge -amount 0 -to merchant1"
```

### Add funds to an account

You can add funds to an account in the same way that you created and added funds to an account in [Create an account with a balance](#create-an-account-with-a-balance).

To add **500** to the account for **customer1**, run the following command:

```console
./gradlew run --args="-action charge -amount 500 -to customer1"
```

The account for **customer1** will now have a balance of **1000**.

### Send electronic money between two accounts

Now that you have created two accounts, with at least one of those accounts having a balance, you can send funds from one account to the other account.

To have **customer1** pay **100** to **merchant1**, run the following command:

```console
./gradlew run --args="-action pay -amount 100 -from customer1 -to merchant1"
```

### Get an account balance

After sending funds from one account to the other, you can check the balance of each account.

To get the balance of **customer1**, run the following command:

```console
./gradlew run --args="-action getBalance -id customer1"
```

You should see the following output:

```console
...
The balance for customer1 is 900
...
```

To get the balance of **merchant1**, run the following command:

```console
./gradlew run --args="-action getBalance -id merchant1"
```

You should see the following output:

```console
...
The balance for merchant1 is 100
...
```

## Stop the database

To stop the database, stop the Docker container by running the following command:

```console
docker compose down
```
