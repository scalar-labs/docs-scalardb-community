# ScalarDB Community Documentation

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The ScalarDB Community docs site repository is no longer maintained and will be archived in the near future since the docs now live on the [ScalarDB docs site](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/).
>
> Currently, all pages from the ScalarDB Community docs site redirect visitors to the ScalarDB docs site. On those page are tags that show whether the contents apply to the Community edition, Enterprise Standard edition, or Enterprise Premium edition of ScalarDB.
