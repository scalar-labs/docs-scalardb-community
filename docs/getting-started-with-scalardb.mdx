# Getting Started with ScalarDB

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This getting started tutorial explains how to configure your preferred database in ScalarDB and illustrates the process of creating a sample e-commerce application, where items can be ordered and paid for with a credit card by using ScalarDB. The sample e-commerce application shows how users can order and pay for items by using a line of credit.

:::warning

Since the focus of the sample application is to demonstrate using ScalarDB, application-specific error handling, authentication processing, and similar functions are not included in the sample application. For details about exception handling in ScalarDB, see [How to handle exceptions](api-guide.mdx#how-to-handle-exceptions).

:::

## Install a JDK

Because ScalarDB is written in Java, you must have one of the following Java Development Kits (JDKs) installed in your environment:

- [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) LTS version (8, 11, 17 or 21)
- OpenJDK LTS version (8, 11, 17, or 21) from [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/), [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/), or [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download)

:::note

We recommend using the LTS versions mentioned above, but other non-LTS versions may work.

In addition, other JDKs should work with ScalarDB, but we haven't tested them.

:::

## Clone the ScalarDB samples repository
 
Open **Terminal**, then clone the ScalarDB samples repository by running the following command:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb-samples
```

Then, go to the directory that contains the sample application by running the following command:

```console
$ cd scalardb-samples/scalardb-sample
```

## Set up your database for ScalarDB

Select your database, and follow the instructions to configure it for ScalarDB.

For a list of databases that ScalarDB supports, see [Supported Databases](scalardb-supported-databases.mdx).

    scalar.db.username=cassandra
    scalar.db.password=cassandra
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create and load the database schema

You need to define the database schema (the method in which the data will be organized) in the application. For details about the supported data types, see [Data type mapping between ScalarDB and other databases](schema-loader.mdx#data-type-mapping-between-scalardb-and-other-databases).

For this tutorial, create a file named **schema.json** in the `scalardb-samples/scalardb-sample` directory. Then, add the following JSON code to define the schema.

```json
{
  "sample.customers": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "customer_id"
    ],
    "columns": {
      "customer_id": "INT",
      "name": "TEXT",
      "credit_limit": "INT",
      "credit_total": "INT"
    }
  },
  "sample.orders": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "customer_id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [
      "timestamp"
    ],
    "secondary-index": [
      "order_id"
    ],
    "columns": {
      "order_id": "TEXT",
      "customer_id": "INT",
      "timestamp": "BIGINT"
    }
  },
  "sample.statements": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "order_id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [
      "item_id"
    ],
    "columns": {
      "order_id": "TEXT",
      "item_id": "INT",
      "count": "INT"
    }
  },
  "sample.items": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "item_id"
    ],
    "columns": {
      "item_id": "INT",
      "name": "TEXT",
      "price": "INT"
    }
  }
}
```

To apply the schema, go to the [`scalardb` Releases](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases) page and download the ScalarDB Schema Loader that matches the version of ScalarDB that you are using to the `scalardb-samples/scalardb-sample` directory.

Then, run the following command, replacing `<VERSION>` with the version of the ScalarDB Schema Loader that you downloaded:

<Tabs groupId="databases" queryString>
  <TabItem value="JDBC_databases" label="JDBC databases" default>
    ```shell
    $ java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="DynamoDB" label="DynamoDB">
    ```shell
    $ java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator --no-backup --no-scaling
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

Also, `--no-backup` and `--no-scaling` options are specified because Amazon DynamoDB Local does not support continuous backup and auto-scaling.

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Cosmos_DB_for_NoSQL" label="Cosmos DB for NoSQL">
    ```shell
    $ java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Cassandra" label="Cassandra">
    ```shell
    $ java -jar scalardb-schema-loader-<VERSION>.jar --config database.properties --schema-file schema.json --coordinator --replication-factor=1
    ```

:::note

The `--coordinator` option is specified because a table with `transaction` set to `true` exists in the schema. For details about configuring and loading a schema, see [ScalarDB Schema Loader](schema-loader.mdx).

In addition, the `--replication-factor=1` option has an effect only when using Cassandra. The default replication factor is `3`, but to facilitate the setup in this tutorial, `1` is used so that you only need to prepare a cluster with one node instead of three nodes. However, keep in mind that a replication factor of `1` is not suited for production.

### Schema details

As shown in [`schema.json`](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb-samples/tree/main/scalardb-sample/schema.json) for the sample application, all the tables are created in the `sample` namespace.

- `sample.customers`: a table that manages customer information
  - `credit_limit`: the maximum amount of money that the lender will allow the customer to spend from their line of credit
  - `credit_total`: the amount of money that the customer has spent from their line of credit
- `sample.orders`: a table that manages order information
- `sample.statements`: a table that manages order statement information
- `sample.items`: a table that manages information for items to be ordered

The Entity Relationship Diagram for the schema is as follows:

![ERD](images/getting-started-ERD.png)

### Load the initial data

Before running the sample application, you need to load the initial data by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="LoadInitialData"
```

After the initial data has loaded, the following records should be stored in the tables.

**`sample.customers` table**

| customer_id | name          | credit_limit | credit_total |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1           | Yamada Taro   | 10000        | 0            |
| 2           | Yamada Hanako | 10000        | 0            |
| 3           | Suzuki Ichiro | 10000        | 0            |

**`sample.items` table**

| item_id | name   | price |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1       | Apple  | 1000  |
| 2       | Orange | 2000  |
| 3       | Grape  | 2500  |
| 4       | Mango  | 5000  |
| 5       | Melon  | 3000  |

## Execute transactions and retrieve data in the sample application

The following sections describe how to execute transactions and retrieve data in the sample e-commerce application.

### Get customer information

Start with getting information about the customer whose ID is `1` by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="GetCustomerInfo 1"
```

You should see the following output:

```console
...
{"id": 1, "name": "Yamada Taro", "credit_limit": 10000, "credit_total": 0}
...
```

### Place an order

Then, have customer ID `1` place an order for three apples and two oranges by running the following command:

:::note

The order format in this command is `./gradlew run --args="PlaceOrder <CUSTOMER_ID> <ITEM_ID>:<COUNT>,<ITEM_ID>:<COUNT>,..."`.

:::

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="PlaceOrder 1 1:3,2:2"
```

You should see a similar output as below, with a different UUID for `order_id`, which confirms that the order was successful:

```console
...
{"order_id": "dea4964a-ff50-4ecf-9201-027981a1566e"}
...
```

### Check order details

Check details about the order by running the following command, replacing `<ORDER_ID_UUID>` with the UUID for the `order_id` that was shown after running the previous command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="GetOrder <ORDER_ID_UUID>"
```

You should see a similar output as below, with different UUIDs for `order_id` and `timestamp`:

```console
...
{"order": {"order_id": "dea4964a-ff50-4ecf-9201-027981a1566e","timestamp": 1650948340914,"customer_id": 1,"customer_name": "Yamada Taro","statement": [{"item_id": 1,"item_name": "Apple","price": 1000,"count": 3,"total": 3000},{"item_id": 2,"item_name": "Orange","price": 2000,"count": 2,"total": 4000}],"total": 7000}}
...
```

### Place another order

Place an order for one melon that uses the remaining amount in `credit_total` for customer ID `1` by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="PlaceOrder 1 5:1"
```

You should see a similar output as below, with a different UUID for `order_id`, which confirms that the order was successful:

```console
...
{"order_id": "bcc34150-91fa-4bea-83db-d2dbe6f0f30d"}
...
```

### Check order history

Get the history of all orders for customer ID `1` by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="GetOrders 1"
```

You should see a similar output as below, with different UUIDs for `order_id` and `timestamp`, which shows the history of all orders for customer ID `1` in descending order by timestamp:

```console
...
{"order": [{"order_id": "dea4964a-ff50-4ecf-9201-027981a1566e","timestamp": 1650948340914,"customer_id": 1,"customer_name": "Yamada Taro","statement": [{"item_id": 1,"item_name": "Apple","price": 1000,"count": 3,"total": 3000},{"item_id": 2,"item_name": "Orange","price": 2000,"count": 2,"total": 4000}],"total": 7000},{"order_id": "bcc34150-91fa-4bea-83db-d2dbe6f0f30d","timestamp": 1650948412766,"customer_id": 1,"customer_name": "Yamada Taro","statement": [{"item_id": 5,"item_name": "Melon","price": 3000,"count": 1,"total": 3000}],"total": 3000}]}
...
```

### Check credit total

Get the credit total for customer ID `1` by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="GetCustomerInfo 1"
```

You should see the following output, which shows that customer ID `1` has reached their `credit_limit` in `credit_total` and cannot place anymore orders:

```console
...
{"id": 1, "name": "Yamada Taro", "credit_limit": 10000, "credit_total": 10000}
...
```

Try to place an order for one grape and one mango by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="PlaceOrder 1 3:1,4:1"
```

You should see the following output, which shows that the order failed because the `credit_total` amount would exceed the `credit_limit` amount.

```console
...
java.lang.RuntimeException: Credit limit exceeded
        at sample.Sample.placeOrder(Sample.java:205)
        at sample.command.PlaceOrderCommand.call(PlaceOrderCommand.java:33)
        at sample.command.PlaceOrderCommand.call(PlaceOrderCommand.java:8)
        at picocli.CommandLine.executeUserObject(CommandLine.java:1783)
        at picocli.CommandLine.access$900(CommandLine.java:145)
        at picocli.CommandLine$RunLast.handle(CommandLine.java:2141)
        at picocli.CommandLine$RunLast.handle(CommandLine.java:2108)
        at picocli.CommandLine$AbstractParseResultHandler.execute(CommandLine.java:1975)
        at picocli.CommandLine.execute(CommandLine.java:1904)
        at sample.command.SampleCommand.main(SampleCommand.java:35)
...
```

### Make a payment

To continue making orders, customer ID `1` must make a payment to reduce the `credit_total` amount.

Make a payment by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="Repayment 1 8000"
```

Then, check the `credit_total` amount for customer ID `1` by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="GetCustomerInfo 1"
```

You should see the following output, which shows that a payment was applied to customer ID `1`, reducing the `credit_total` amount:

```console
...
{"id": 1, "name": "Yamada Taro", "credit_limit": 10000, "credit_total": 2000}
...
```

Now that customer ID `1` has made a payment, place an order for one grape and one melon by running the following command:

```console
$ ./gradlew run --args="PlaceOrder 1 3:1,4:1"
```

You should see a similar output as below, with a different UUID for `order_id`, which confirms that the order was successful:

```
...
{"order_id": "8911cab3-1c2b-4322-9386-adb1c024e078"}
...
```

## Stop the database

To stop the database, stop the Docker container by running the following command:

```console
$ docker compose down
```
